Compute ln(a). Let f(x) = ln(x), We know that f'(x) = 1/x, thus from Taylor's theorem we have: -----          n+1         n f(x) =   \           (-1)    (x - 1) /          ----------------    for 1 <= n <= infinity -----             n or 2        3       4 (x-1)   (x-1)    (x-1) ln(x) =  (x-1) - ----- + ------ - ------ + ... 2       3        4 alternatively, 2    3   4 x    x   x ln(x+1) =  x - -  + - - - + ... 2    3   4 This series can be used to compute ln(x), but it converges too slowly. If we substitute -x for x above, we get 2    3    4 x    x    x ln(1-x) =  -x - -  - -  - - + ... 2    3    4 Note that all terms are now negative.  Because the even powered ones absorbed the sign.  Now, subtract the series above from the previous one to get ln(x+1) - ln(1-x).  Note the even terms cancel out leaving only the odd ones 3     5      7 2x    2x     2x ln(x+1) - ln(x-1) = 2x + --- + --- + ---- + ... 3     5      7 By the property of logarithms that ln(a) - ln(b) = ln (a/b) we have: 3        5        7 x+1           /          x        x        x          \ ln ----- =   2 *  |  x  +   ----  +  ----  +  ---- + ...  | x-1           \          3        5        7          / But now we want to find ln(a), so we need to find the value of x such that a = (x+1)/(x-1).   This is easily solved to find that x = (a-1)/(a+1).

add the unique identify of a file to the set of open files
Pad the image with extra space. The padding percent works by taking the largest side of the current image, multiplying that with the percent value, and adding that portion to each side of the image. So for example, an image that's 100x100, with 50% padding percent, ends up resized to (50+100+50)x(50+100+50), or 200x200. The 100x100 portion is then centered, taking up what looks like 50% of the final image. The same 100x100 image, with 100% padding, ends up at 300x300, looking in the final image like it takes up ~33% of the space. Padding can also be negative, which eats into the space of the original asset, causing a zoom in effect.

Naive Side Effect Tester -- Use a naive side effect analysis even if interprocedural  information is available. If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to true, Lazy Code Motion  uses the conservative side effect information provided by the  NaiveSideEffectTester class, even if interprocedural information  about side effects is available. The naive side effect analysis  is based solely on the information available locally about a  statement. It assumes, for example, that any method call has the  potential to write and read all instance and static fields in  the program. If Naive Side Effect Tester is set to false and  Soot is in whole program mode, then Lazy Code Motion uses the  side effect information provided by the PASideEffectTester  class. PASideEffectTester uses a points-to analysis to determine  which fields and statics may be written or read by a given  statement. If whole program analysis is not performed, naive  side effect information is used regardless of the setting of  Naive Side Effect Tester.

Include a lease in the managed set for a specified duration and with specified renewal duration. <p> The semantics of this method are similar to those of the four-argument form of <code>renewUntil</code>, with <code>desiredDuration</code> + current time being used for the value of the <code>desiredExpiration</code> argument of <code>renewUntil</code>. The only exception to this is that, in the context of <code>renewFor</code>, the value of the <code>renewDuration</code> argument may only be <code>Lease.ANY</code> if the value of the <code>desiredDuration</code> argument is <em>exactly</em> <code>Lease.FOREVER.</code> <p> This method tests for arithmetic overflow in the desired expiration time computed from the value of <code>desiredDuration</code> argument (<code>desiredDuration</code> + current time). Should such overflow be present, a value of <code>Lease.FOREVER</code> is used to represent the lease's desired expiration time.

Reads the contents of an InputStream into a byte[].
Feed the input data into the external module, and return the result. This method is responsible for the timer and timeout handling and is regarded as generic for all external modules, thus <code>final</code>. The actual input and output is performed by <code>externalIO()</code> and may be overridden by subclasses to account for module-specifics. <p/> If timeout occurs, the external module is restarted, and a second attempt is made. If it fails again, an IOException is thrown. Even in case of the second failure, the external process is restarted, because failure may have been provoked by this particular input. <p/> For the time being, external modules are thread-safe simply by this method being <code>synchronized</code>.

(2) Read-after-write hazard Before the connection succeeds, some sticky events (e1, e2 and e3) are put into the queue. Then when the connection succeeds, they are posted one by one. However, after e1 is posted, we get a sticky event. I should guarantee that we get e3 rather than e1.

Appends a new member to the end of this object, with the specified name and the specified JSON value. <p> This method <strong>does not prevent duplicate names</strong>. Calling this method with a name that already exists in the object will append another member with the same name. In order to replace existing members, use the method <code>set(name, value)</code> instead. However, <strong> <em>add</em> is much faster than <em>set</em></strong> (because it does not need to search for existing members). Therefore <em>add</em> should be preferred when constructing new objects. </p>

NOTE that this is a funny case where the auto-retry in the service engine for the call to testServiceLockWaitTimeoutRetryCantRecoverWaiter would NOT be able to recover because it would try again given the new transaction and all, but the lock for the waiting thread would still be there... so it will fail repeatedly. TODO: there's got to be some way to do this, but how?!? :( NOTE: maybe this will work: create a list that the service engine maintains of services it will run after the current service run is complete, and AFTER it has committed or rolled back its transaction; if a service finds it has a lock wait timeout, add itself to the list for its parent service (somehow...) and off we go!

Add a face to a face list. The input face is specified as an image with a targetFace rectangle. It returns an persistedFaceId representing the added face, and persistedFaceId will not expire. <p> The persistedFaceId will be used in output JSON of Face - Find Similar, or in Face List - Delete a Face from a Face List to remove face from a face list. JPEG, PNG, GIF(the first frame), and BMP are supported. The image file size should be no larger than 4MB. The detectable face size is between 36x36 to 4096x4096 pixels. The faces out of this range will not be detected. Rectangle specified by targetFace should contain exactly one face. Zero or multiple faces will be regarded as an error. Out of detectable face size, large head-pose, or very large occlusions will also result in fail to add a person face. The given rectangle specifies both face location and face size at the same time. There is no guarantee of corrent result if you are using rectangle which are not returned from Face - Detect. Face list is a group of faces, and these faces will not expire. Face list is used as a parameter of source faces in Face - Find Similar. Face List is useful when to find similar faces in a fixed face set very often, e.g. to find a similar face in a face list of celebrities, friends, or family members. <p> A face list can have a maximum of 1000 faces.

Safe forName -- Handle Class.forName() calls conservatively. When a program calls Class.forName(), the named class is  resolved, and its static initializer executed. In many cases, it  cannot be determined statically which class will be loaded, and  which static initializer executed. When this option is set to  true, Soot will conservatively assume that any static  initializer could be executed. This may make the call graph very  large. When this option is set to false, any calls to  Class.forName() for which the class cannot be determined  statically are assumed to call no static initializers.

Format method for the g conversion character. <p/> For g format, the flag character '-', means that the output should be left justified within the field.  The default is to pad with blanks on the left.  '+' character means that the conversion will always begin with a sign (+ or -).  The blank flag character means that a non-negative input will be preceded with a blank.  If both a '+' and a ' ' are specified, the blank flag is ignored.  The '0' flag character implies that padding to the field width will be done with zeros instead of blanks. <p/> The field width is treated as the minimum number of characters to be printed.  The default is to add no padding.  Padding is with blanks by default. <p/> The precision, if set, is the minimum number of digits to appear after the radix character. Padding is with trailing 0s.
